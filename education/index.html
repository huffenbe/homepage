	<h2>Education and Outreach</h2>

	<h3> Outreach </h3>

	<p>
	  <b><a href="http://astrophysics.physics.fsu.edu/observatory/"> FSU Observatory </a></b><br/>
	  The FSU Observatory was constructed on top of the Doak Campbell Stadium in 2019 and houses a 17-inch, f/6.8 robotic telescope.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <b><a href="https://physics.fsu.edu/saturday-morning-physics"> Saturday Morning Physics </a></b><br/>
	  Outreach program in the Fall semester.
	</p>

	<h3> Teaching </h3>

	<p>	Courses in the PI's recent rotation include:</p>
	
	<p><b><a href='http://athens.physics.fsu.edu/huffenbe/astrolab'>AST 3721L. Astrophysics Laboratory</a></b><br />
	  2 credits.   Prerequisite: PHY 3101.  This course offers an introduction to experimental methodology, data analysis and interpretation, calibration techniques, scientific model validation, as well as data presentation and communication of results. The laboratory experiments have astrophysical relevance and include magnetic fields, optical interference and diffraction, wave polarization, line spectroscopy, photoelectric effect, and radioactive decay.
	</p>

	<p><b>AST 5765. Advanced Analysis Techniques in Astronomy</b><br/>
This course offers a survey of advanced data-analysis and statistical techniques available to modern astronomical researchers. Topics include subpixel imaging, image deconvolution, point-spread function modeling, crowded field photometry, survey completeness, Malmquist and other statistical biases, automated data mining, image differencing techniques, astrometric solutions, working with low-signal-to-noise data, fitting models to data, modeling synthetic data, as well as real-world error determination.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Past Teaching </h3>

	<p><b>AST 4218r / AST 5219r. Astrophysics Seminar</b><br />
	1 credit.  Prerequisite: AST 4211. This seminar introduces students to current research topics in astronomy and astrophysics through presentation and discussion of recently published research papers, their own research work, and occasional review publications. Topics cover observational and theoretical astrophysics alike. May be repeated to a maximum of two semester hours.</p>

	<p><b>AST 4722. Observational Techniques in Astrophysics</b><br/>
	  3 credits.  Prerequisite: AST 4211. This course covers principles and techniques used in obtaining modern astronomical data. Includes an overview of current and next-generation astronomical instrumentation, discussion of calibration schemes and observing strategies, and an introduction to analysis techniques.</p>
	
	<p><b>PHY 2054C. College Physics B</b><br/>
	4 credits. Prerequisite: PHY 2053C or PHY 2048C. Corequisite: PHY 2054L. This course is an introduction to electromagnetism, light, and modern physics for non-physical-science majors. Two lectures, one recitation, and one laboratory each week. Students who have previously received credit for PHY 2049C may not register for PHY 2054C. </p>


	
	<h5> At University of Miami </h5>
	


	<p><b>Physics 101. College Physics I</b><br />  
	  4 credits.  Elementary mechanics, thermal phenomena, fluids, waves. Courses Physics 101-102-106-108 provide a ten credit "physics with lab" sequence for premedical students and others.
	  <br>Prerequisite: Mth 108 or 105</p>




	<p><b>Physics 102. College Physics II</b><br />
	  4 credits.  Electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics.
<br>Prerequisite: Phy 101</p>



	<p><b>Physics 110. Descriptive Astronomy</b><br />
	  3 credits. For students not majoring in Mathematics or a Physical Science. brief non-technical treatment of the universe and its contents. Mathematical requirements are minimal with emphasis on our present knowledge about energy and matter in space.
<br>
Prerequisite: Not for major or minor
</p>



	<p><b>Physics 545. Astrophysics</b><br />
	  3 credits. 
This course surveys topics in astrophysics from the origin of the universe to the evolution of the stars and galaxies that occupy it.  The course will focus on the physical principles necessary to develop and understanding of these objects and processes.
